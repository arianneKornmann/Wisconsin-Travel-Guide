                    <p>Epic is a software company that was founded in a basement in 1979 with 3 part-time employees. 
                       They create software to help people get well, help people stay well, and help future generations 
                       be healthier. It seems odd to be touring a software companies’ headquarters…but you won’t want 
                       to miss out. Epic’s headquarters is straight out of storybook. Tour through their Barn, 
                       Ella’s Carousel, Deep Space, Emerald City, Wizards Academy, and Treehouse.</p>

                    <p>Jurustic Park documents the amateur paleontologist, Clyde Wynia. Clyde has created crazy replicas 
                       of extinct creatures that were near Marshfield, Wisconsin during the Iron Age. He has large, 
                       medium, and small replicas that he has built overtime made of metal, mild steel, and occasionally 
                       stainless steel. </p>
