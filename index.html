            <div class="history">
                    Wisconsin became a U.S. territory following the American Revolution. Soon after, it began attracting settlers who were 
                looking for work in its hustling mining, lumber, and dairy industries. It was admitted to the union as the 30th state in 
                1848. The years leading up to the civil war, Wisconsin was an important stop on the Underground Railroad which held many 
                slaves passing through on their way to freedom in Canada. In current times, Wisconsin leads the nation in dairy production.
                Wisconsins current population is 5,931,367.
